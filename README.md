# Stir Me a Cocktail
See what you've got, and see what you can make!

## Description
This single page application allows users to view and select various cocktail ingredients that they own or plan to buy. Based on these inputs, the program searches for all possible cocktails that the user can make and renders them to individual drink cards. Each drink card contains the drink name, image, and ingredients, as well as the corresponding measurements and instructions. Users have the option to edit their ingredients list and / or select all the ingredients to view all cocktail cards.

## API
This application utilizes TheCocktailDB API (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php), particularly their alphabetized cocktail data (a.g. https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?f=a). TheCocktailDB is an external API that allows developers to use a test API key "1" during development or for educational use.
