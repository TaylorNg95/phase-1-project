# Phase 1 Project

1. Theme:
2. Public API vs JSON Server:
3. Project Plan:
    - As a user, I should be able to:
        -> Select ingredients that I have / would like to use (Font Awesome Icons) -> MOUSEOVER/OUT, CLICK
        -> Submit the ingredients list by clicking "Make Some Drinks"; view a loading gif -> SUBMIT
        -> View the full list of drinks (view pic and name) I could make using those ingredients
        -> Click each drink and see the ingredients, measurements, and instructions -> MOUSEOVER/OUT, CLICK

        -> On my side, I want to fetch all the drinks data after DOM CONTENT LOADED
        -> I need to be able go through each of the each drink and test if they are found in the
        userIngredients array - filter out drinks that have ingredients not in userIngredients


IMPORTANT: Projects should be Minimal Viable Products (MVPs)
